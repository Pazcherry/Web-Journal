                <a href="#" class="blog-title">What is Artificial Intelligence?</a>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer<span id="dots">...
              </span><span id="more"> systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.

                    How does AI work?
                    As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.
                    
                    In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, images, music and other media.
                    
                    AI programming focuses on cognitive skills that include the following:
                    
                    Learning. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn it into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.
                    Reasoning. This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.
                    Self-correction. This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.
                    Creativity. This aspect of AI uses neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, new text, new music and new ideas.</span></p>

            <span>10 May 2023 / IOT</span>
            <a href="#" class="blog-title">Internet of Things</a>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more than 7 billion connected IoT devices today, experts are expecting this number to grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025. Oracle has a network of device partners.

                Why is Internet of Things (IoT) so important?
                Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday objects—kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors—to the internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things.
                
                By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world—and they cooperate.
                
                What technologies have made IoT possible?
                While the idea of IoT has been in existence for a long time, a collection of recent advances in a number of different technologies has made it practical.
                
                Access to low-cost, low-power sensor technology. Affordable and reliable sensors are making IoT technology possible for more manufacturers.
                Connectivity. A host of network protocols for the internet has made it easy to connect sensors to the cloud and to other “things” for efficient data transfer.
                Cloud computing platforms. The increase in the availability of cloud platforms enables both businesses and consumers to access the infrastructure they need to scale up without actually having to manage it all.
                Machine learning and analytics. With advances in machine learning and analytics, along with access to varied and vast amounts of data stored in the cloud, businesses can gather insights faster and more easily. The emergence of these allied technologies continues to push the boundaries of IoT and the data produced by IoT also feeds these technologies.
                Conversational artificial intelligence (AI). Advances in neural networks have brought natural-language processing (NLP) to IoT devices (such as digital personal assistants Alexa, Cortana, and Siri) and made them appealing, affordable, and viable for home use.</span></p>

                <p>What is augmented reality or AR?
                    Integrating state-of-the-art technology can help keep your business<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> competitive. With augmented reality (AR), you will bridge the physical and digital worlds to better guide and train employees, solve problems faster, optimize efficiencies, improve productivity and collaboration, and better prepare for the future.
                
                    Understanding augmented reality
                    What is AR? Augmented reality is an enhanced, interactive version of a real-world environment achieved through digital visual elements, sounds, and other sensory stimuli via holographic technology. AR incorporates three features: a combination of digital and physical worlds, interactions made in real time, and accurate 3D identification of virtual and real objects.
                    
                    Augmented reality offers a better way to design, curate, and deliver consumable instructions by overlaying digital content in real-world work environments. When a business understands what AR is and how to utilize it successfully, everyone can work remotely while collaborating efficiently.</span> </p>

                <p>What exactly is big data?

                    The definition of big data is data that contains greater variety, arriving in increasing<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> volumes and with more velocity. This is also known as the three Vs.
                    
                    Put simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just cannot manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you would not have been able to tackle before.</span></p>

                    What is quantum cloud computing, and how does it work?<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    Quantum cloud computing employs quantum principles to distributed computing, while cloud computing uses remote servers to provide distributed computing services. Cloud computing simply refers to providing services such as data storage, servers, databases and networking via the internet.
                
                    What do you mean by smart farming?
                    Smart farming is a management concept focused on providing the agricultural industry with the infrastructure to leverage advanced technology – including big data, the cloud and the internet of things (IoT) – for tracking, monitoring, automating and analyzing operations.

            <p>What is nanotechnology?
                
                Nanotechnology refers to the branch of science and engineering devoted to<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> designing, producing, and using structures, devices, and systems by manipulating atoms and molecules at nanoscale, i.e. having one or more dimensions of the order of 100 nanometres (100 millionth of a millimetre) or less.
                
                In the natural world, there are many examples of structures with one or more nanometre dimensions, and many technologies have incidentally involved such nanostructures for many years, but only recently has it been possible to do it intentionally.
                
                Many of the applications of nanotechnology involve new materials that have very different properties and new effects compared to the same materials made at larger sizes. This is due to the very high surface to volume ratio of nanoparticles compared to larger particles, and to effects that appear at that small scale but are not observed at larger scales.
                
                The applications of nanotechnology can be very beneficial and have the potential to make a significant impact on society. Nanotechnology has already been embraced by industrial sectors, such as the information and communications sectors, but is also used in food technology, energy technology, as well as in some medical products and medicines. Nanomaterials may also offer new opportunities for the reduction of environmental pollution.</span></p>

                <a href="#" class="blog-title">Computer Vision, Cyber Security and Additive Manufacturing</a>
                <p>What is computer vision?
                    Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
                    
                    Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.
                    
                    Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex. Because a system trained to inspect products or watch a production asset can analyze thousands of products or processes a minute, noticing imperceptible defects or issues, it can quickly surpass human capabilities.
                
                    What is Cyber Security?
                    Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.
                    
                    ·         Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
                    
                    ·         Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.
                    
                    ·         Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.
                    
                    ·         Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
                    
                    ·         Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.
                    
                    ·         End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.

                    What is meant by additive manufacturing?

                    What is additive manufacturing? Additive manufacturing is the process of creating an object by building it one layer at a time. It is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing, in which an object is created by cutting away at a solid block of material until the final product is complete
